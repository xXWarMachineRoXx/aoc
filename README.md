# Advent of code 2022 


## Introduction 
Hey 👋, SO i started AOC by accidentally falling into a hole of googling 🧑‍💻 stuff 
( like pretty much anything else i do )

✍️ Writing it here for safekeeping and helping out anyone who's stuck. 

📅 Till today 12 July 2023, All solutions ( XD just 2 ) have been thought and coded by myself

If you are burnt out from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) , [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) can be a nice breezer for you.


## Terms of Use (AOC)
> increment: The action of increasing or becoming greater.

Advent of Code is **free** to use.

However, building and running Advent of Code takes a significant amount of my time and energy. If you like Advent of Code, would like more things like it in the future, and are able to do so, please support Advent of Code.

Your contributions support things like:

- Infrastructure (hosting, bandwidth, etc)
- Time spent running Advent of Code events
- Time spent building puzzles
- More future projects
- My sushi addiction
- Because you are logged in, if you proceed, you will get a supporter badge next to your name on all Advent of Code 2022 pages. You can switch to a different event on the [Events] page.


You can support Advent of Code via [PayPal](https://adventofcode.com/2022/support/paypal) or, [if you must](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption), [Coinbase](https://adventofcode.com/2022/support/coinbase).

(Amounts under $1 barely reach me after fees and will not confer a badge. Please be patient; some transactions, especially using cryptocurrencies, can take an hour or two to complete.)
